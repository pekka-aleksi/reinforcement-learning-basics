Reinforcement Learning basics
===

This is my simple version of a Markov Decision Process as a Python class, and the code to train it with Policy Iteration.

I have included code to draw the MDP.

This is a "dice throwing game" where the computer tries to learn a strategy.

It is still a 'work in progress' in-so-far that I am trying to make *sure* that there actually is a reasonable strategy for the computer to learn.
It seems like the versions of the game so far have been very crudely unbalanced.





The example for the code for the training was from some Internet post - so unknown person if you ever see this, thank you very much! Kudos!
